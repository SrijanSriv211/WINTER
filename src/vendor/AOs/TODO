Implement a faster and better search algo
Rewrite README with more details about AOs and how to use it documentation.
A lot of bugs in custom ReadLine's autocomplete suggestion. Fix them all.

. Another bug in ReadLine, when the scroll wheel appears after a long text being printed, then the ReadLine function fails to work.
. Lexer is also broken, fix it. Quick.
. If the string is too long that a new line is being created then it fails to do that and crashes. Fix it.
. Delete history.json from 'Files.x72\root' folder from source.
. Build a search engine which can search for any file, folder or app in your PC like Ueli, Windows search or Apple Spotlight
. Copy paste of text doesn't work bug in custom ReadLine function.
. The "shutdown" command won't shutdown the host machine. Also check if the "restart" commands has the same problem or not.
. Autocomplete filenames when pressed tab.
. settings - print everything from setting.json except cmds.
. Re-work 'build.py' and leave all the stuff to 'AOs.dev'
. Refactor the entire AOs.
. Upgrade dotnet from donet 7 to 8 for AOs 2.6
. Implement a spell-checker (wagner-ficher) algo in AOs error log.
. There are some bugs in AOs.Parser, fix them. For eg, ">" doesn't work but ">." works. Basically if no argument is passed then ">" won't even be called. Fix it and make it work more better with the new Lexer.
. Remove Experimental features.
. For input 'shout "%username%"' this is the output 'SrijanSrivastava'. This is a bug in lexer. Fix it.
. Lexer fails to work with prompt system. Fix it.
. Move all features, history and other things to a json file and read that json file to make implementation and extention of all of these easier.
. Remove datetime, random, sysinfo, tree
. Fix bug 'start .' doesn't open the current folder and shows a crash error. More in Crashreport.log
. In the 'history' command also show in which session the command was passed just like Instagram's message page where the messeages are seperated by sessions of time and date
. Make the 'help <command-name>' page more useful and informational about the command.
. Improve help messages, giving more detail about the command - such as how to use - when the input is like `help <command-name>`
. Further improve the ';' (run multiple commands in a single line) feature. Make it work like a programming language.
