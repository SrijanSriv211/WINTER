# <img title="AOs" src="https://github.com/Light-Lens/AOs/blob/master/img/AOs.ico?raw=true" width="32" height="32"> AOs

A simple tool built to control UI based tasks directly through the command-line, for example changeing system wallpaper, enabling/disabling dark mode, opening any app or website from the command-line just like you do with the UI of some application launcher such as [Ueli](https://github.com/oliverschwendener/ueli), doing basic math calculations on the command-line, and etc.

## :gear: Getting AOs
### :eyes: Usage
1. Download the latest version of [AOs](https://github.com/Light-Lens/AOs/releases) by clicking on the releases link.
2. Extract `AOs.zip` file and run `AOs.exe` file.
3. To use the backslash character inside double or single quotes in AOs, use double backslashes or single forward slash:

:heavy_check_mark: Correct way:
```console
AOs 2024 [Version 2.6]  (User)
$ "path\\to\\dir"
$ "path/to/dir"
```

:x: Wrong way:
```console
AOs 2024 [Version 2.6]  (User)
$ "path\to\dir"
```

AOs follows the same string handling conventions as in C#.

4. To see a list of all supported commands, type `help` in the AOs window:
```console
AOs 2024 [Version 2.6]  (User)
$ help
```

## :toolbox: Getting Started for Developers
AOs is officially untested on other development environments whilst I focus on a Windows build, but you can modify it to work cross-platform. Visual Studio Code is recommended for development.

### :bangbang: Prerequisites
You need to install the following on your machine.
- [Dotnet Core 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3122)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### :pencil: Getting Started
<ins>**1. Downloading the repository:**</ins>

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Light-Lens/AOs`.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init --recursive` to clone the necessary submodules.

<ins>**2. Running and Compiling AOs:**</ins>

1. To run the program use:
```console
python scripts\build.py run
```

2. To compile the program don't use dotnet build, instead run:
```console
python scripts\build.py
```

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: The Plan
I'm building AOs because I'm working on virtual assistant called [WINTER](https://github.com/Light-Lens/WINTER) for which I want such a tool which can help me automate tasks that require GUI to be involved.

The goal of AOs is to let the user do simple things such as changing the wallpaper, switching to dark/light mode, launching an app or website like [Ueli](https://github.com/oliverschwendener/ueli) does, do some basic math calculations directly from the command-line.

The reason why I'm building AOs and WINTER both separately is because I thought AOs as an independent tool maybe useful of many people.
